## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN
- Other dependencies can be installed using `environment.yml`
  
## Getting Started
### Installation

- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ktlProject0/KTL_project_06_MRI_BrainCancer_Segmentation.git
cd KTL_project_06_MRI_BrainCancer_Segmentation
```
 - You can create a new Conda environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

### PolypSegmentation train/test

- Train a model:
To train the model, run the following script. You can modify training hyperparameters (such as epochs, learning rate, batch size) in train.py.
```bash
#if you run with gpu:
  python train.py --data_direc ./data --cuda
#else you run with cpu:
  python train.py --data_direc ./data
```
- Test the model:
Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance on the test set by running the test.py script.
```bash
#if you run with gpu:
  python test.py --data_direc ./data/ --cuda
#else you run with cpu:
  python test.py --data_direc ./data
```

## Saving Results

During the testing process, the following will be saved automatically in the `test_results/` directory:

1. **Training and Validation Learning Curve**:  
   A plot of the training and validation loss across epochs is saved as `learning_graph_dice_coefficient.png`. This graph helps visualize how the model performance evolves during the training process.

2. **Test Accuracy and Loss**:  
   The accuracy and loss from the test set evaluation are saved in a `metric_df.csv` file. The CSV file will include columns such as `Cross Entropy Loss` and `Dice Coefficient Score` for better tracking of the model's performance.
   
These results can be used for further analysis and tuning of the model.

## Inference and Visualization

You can perform inference on a single image and visualize the results. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
python visualize_sample.py --src_name [image_name]
```

This will save the original image along with the inference result in the `test_results/` directory. The file will be saved with the src_name you provide, making it easy to track the visualized outputs.
